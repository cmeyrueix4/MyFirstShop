I am currently working through a NodeJS course where a multitude of different technologies are touched upon. This includes frameworks such as Pug, Express.js, and MongoDB. The course also touches upon MVC and REST API's. 

Throughout this course I am creating a Store website that touches upon all the topics listed above and more. I am working on everything from the front-end to the back-end and am excited to learn about more current technologies! 

I have put into seperate folders the different versions of this application to be able to fully compare the differences and have a reference for later. I first created one where store data was saved to a local file, then implemented with MySql, then sequelize, and finally a mongodb version. All of these versions can be found in the differentImplementations folder. Currently working with the mongoose implemenation. 

What I've touched on so far:
  - CSS styling
  - HTML
  - Express.js
  - Different templating engines including: Pug, Handlebars, and EJS
  - MVC Pattern
  - Dynamic routes with EJS
  - SQL and NoSQL
  - MySQL
  - Sequelize
  - MongoDB: Atlas, Compass, Mongoose
  - Cookies and Sessions
  - Bcryptjs
  - Authentication
  - Automatic Emails
  - Multer file upload
  - PDF generation with PDFkit
  - Pagination
  - Payment through Stripe
  - REST APIs
