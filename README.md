I am currently working through a NodeJS course where a multitude of different technologies are touched upon. This includes frameworks such as Pug, Express.js, and MongoDB. The course also touches upon MVC and REST API's. 

This project can be run through npm start and accessed through localhost:3000.

Throughout this course I am creating a Store website that touches upon all the topics listed above and more. I am working on everything from the front-end to the back-end and am excited to learn about more current technologies! 

I have put into seperate folders the different versions of this application to be able to fully compare the differences and have a reference for later. I first created one where store data was saved to a local file which can be found in 'writetolocalfileversion' and another folder that shows how it was implemented with MySql (not including Sequelize) in 'mysqlversion'. 

What I've touched on so far:
  - CSS styling
  - HTML
  - Express.js
  - Different templating engines including: Pug, Handlebars, and EJS
  - MVC Pattern
  - Dynamic routes with EJS
  - SQL and NoSQL
  - MySQL
  - Sequelize
  - MongoDB: Compass, Mongoose
