# MyFirstShop

I am currently working through a NodeJS course where a multitude of different technologies are touched upon. This includes frameworks such as Pug, Express.js, and MongoDB. The course also touches upon MVC and REST API's. 

Throughout this course I am creating a Shopping website that touches upon all the topics listed above and more. I am working on everything from the front-end to the back-end and am excited to learn about more current technologies!
